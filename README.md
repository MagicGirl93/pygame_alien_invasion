### Definition
Small repository with alien invasion videogame I've built

### Installation
Clone the repository and install pygame. I built it using python 3.7

`pip install pygame`

### How to play
Go to the directory folder an execute:

`python alien_invasion.py`

The game will restart automatically, press '**q**' to exit the game. You can modify some of the basic settings of the videogame in the file settings.py
